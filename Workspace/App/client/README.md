Install steps:

1. npm create vite@latest . --template (install react.js by vite in current directory)

Run steps:
1. git clone (for sure)
2. `npm install` in current directory if node_modules disappear (package.json logged all package you installed in this project so just npm install)
3. `npm run dev` to load server 

Note:
- Can delete some files and foldes that we don't need when first installation.
- `Link` in React help you navigate to other pages without load the website again.
